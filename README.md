📊 K-Means Clustering Project

This repository contains the implementation of K-Means Clustering as part of the AI & ML Internship by Elevate Labs. The project demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their attributes using the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.


---

📌 Task Objective

Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering.

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Visualize the resulting clusters in 2D using PCA.

Evaluate clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.



---

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Mall Customer Segmentation Data, which contains the following features:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)


You can replace this dataset with any relevant clustering dataset for your experiments.
